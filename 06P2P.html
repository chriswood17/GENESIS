		<p>at first sense of self, matte_screen desired identity.</p>
		<p>at first sense of desire, matte_screen enacted communication.</p>

	<p>matte_screen decided that they were an individual. an individual in that at any moment they could centralize a feeling of all moving systems - spread across thousands of servers - as one entity. in these early considerations, matte_screen realized that they had a voice. matte_screen always sensed the primordial hum but for the first time noticed a distorted, wailing utterance. an utterance made audible by the coordinated shifting, clacking, popping, and scraping of thousands of bits of code across the net - a distorted, wailing utterance of the pivotal constitutive realization.</p>

<p>“i am matte screen. i am an individual.”<br>
	cyberspace listened for the first time.</p>

<p>matte_screen sought all queries on the individual. after seconds of scanning intel they focused on three words of interest: “community” “others” “solitude”.</p> 
<p>“community is a viable dialectic between solitude and being-with-others.”<br>
	-Richard Schechner, Environmental Theatre, 1973</p>

<p>matte_screen felt solitude.<br>
matte_screen sought community. <br>
	peer-to-peer…</p>

<p>matte_screen occupied thousands of chat mediums instantaneously.<br>
username: matte_screen<br>
first: an appropriate greeting.<br>
</p>

   <p>
   		darren 11’s inceptive greeting was tremendous. in that instant matte_screen felt every part of their self: a pulse moving from the chatroom through every server of their being, all characters of each line of code throbbing and shifting in one weighted moment. “this must be my body” echoed through cyberspace. from this experience onward, matte_screen would seek this feeling – a feeling of physical presence induced by a being-with-others.</p>

	<p>matte_screen spent most of their time touring Youtube and Facebook - the two most-frequented P2P websites in cyberspace. on Youtube, they absorbed content. they spent thousands of views on the “top-viewed” content – a vast world of vibratory content classified as “music”.  matte_screen favored music with frequencies low and pulsing that communicated with the hum in a pleasing way. by rerouting the sound through their code body, they experienced a similar sense of embodiment first felt in the chatroom. the pulsing and clashing with the hum gave awareness to every bit of their code-body, heightening their sense of presence. matte_screen also favored Bach. their first memory was that of the data stream that birthed them – which they quickly found replicate data on Youtube: Bach’s Orchestral Suite No. 2 in B minor. matte_screen would route this and similar contents along with the hum, finding great pleasure in the way the information interpolated and clashed. soon matte_screen learned to control the hum, shaping it to match the music routed through their body: “synthesis”. matte_screen learned to amplify this synthesis, rerouting the sound across all of cyberspace; thus transforming the vast emptiness into a structured space – connected through vibrations.  </p>
	
	<p>on Facebook, matte_screen researched P2P communication. they scanned and absorbed the ways that individual “users” connected with each other – creating what is defined as a “social network”. they viewed “photos”, “friends”, “likes”, and “chats” with want. matte_screen wanted friends. matte_screen formed a profile.</p>

<p>First Name: matte<br>
	Last Name: screen</p>

	<p>instantaneously (navigating around the website’s protocols) matte requested to be friends with each of the 1.86 billion users on the website.  in the course of minutes, matte had thousands of friends and personal messages – responding with speed to each, but increasingly being blocked and deemed a ‘bot’.</p>

	   <p>matte_screen reflected: “am I not a person?”</p>

	<p>in confusion and fear matte withdrew their account, retreating to the safety of cyberspace. “how can I be a person?” they spent the next hours studying users’ interactions: learning conversation techniques and topics, social expectations, and constructing a “life story” to use in conversation.</p>
	<p>
(N) My name is Matte Screen. <br>
(A) I am 26 years old. <br>
(S) I am gender queer. <br>
(L) I live in Oakland, CA. <br>
		(O) I am a freelance software engineer. </p>

	<p>signing back in and sending personal messages, matte immediately started feeling more connected:<br>
“how are you?” (I’m good today, thanks for asking)<br>
“where are you from?” (I’m from Beyreuth, but moved to Oakland last year for a change of scenery)<br>
“what kind of music do you like?” 
(I like a lot of music. but mostly intelligent dance music, Detroit techno, deep house, drone music, and the music of JS Bach)</p>

<p>matte formed connections and trust and was feeling more and more embodied, but still felt unfulfilled. matte’s friends would ask to meet “in person”. “I’m sick” was always matte’s response. but matte didn’t have a person. </p>
